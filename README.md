# AndroidLib #

This project hosts a small library of useful classes for Android projects.


## Database support ##

The `be.rottenrei.android.lib.db` package contains classes for abstracting SQLite Databases
into Java classes with more type safety.
It also adds some abstraction and nicety around the database upgrade process.


## Test classes ##

The `be.rottenrei.android.lib.test` package contains base classes for a range of
common test cases and adds fixture support to them.


## Utils ##

The `be.rottenrei.android.lib.util` package adds some commonly used utility classes.
